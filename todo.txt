Task: Build a Simple Blog Application
Objective: Create a simple blog application where users can register, log in, create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

Requirements:
User Authentication:
Implement user registration and login using Laravel's built-in authentication system.
Ensure proper validation and error handling.

Blog Posts:
Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
Each post should have a title, content, and a timestamp for when it was created and last updated.
Validate the input data (e.g., title should be required and have a maximum length, content should be required).
User Interface:

Use Laravel Blade templates to create the views.
Include basic styling (CSS) for a user-friendly interface.
Provide navigation links for easy access (e.g., Home, Create Post, My Posts, Logout).

Database:
Use Laravel migrations to create the necessary database tables.

Routing:
Define appropriate routes for the application (e.g., web.php).
Implement route protection to ensure only authenticated users can create, update, or delete posts.

Validation and Error Handling:
Implement server-side validation for all forms.
Display appropriate error messages to the user.

Code Quality:
Follow best practices for code organization and readability.
Include comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

Bonus (optional but a plus):
Add a feature for users to leave comments on posts.
Use Laravelâ€™s Eloquent ORM relationships (e.g., User hasMany Posts, Post hasMany Comments).

Evaluation Criteria:
Functionality: Ensure the application meets all the specified requirements.
Code Quality: Evaluate the readability, organization, and comments in the code.

Validation: Check for proper validation and error handling.
UI/UX: Assess the user interface and overall user experience.
Database Design: Review the database schema and use of migrations.
